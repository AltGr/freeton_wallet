Quick Start
===========

Initial Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To be able to use :code:`ft`, we will need some tools from TON-SDK
(:code:`tonos-cli`, :code:`tvm_linker`, :code:`solc` and
:code:`stdlib_sol.tvm`) to be installed in :code:`$HOME/.ft/bin/`.

For that, :code:`ft` provides a simple command that will download
their sources and build them, provided that you have a recent version
of Rust installed::

  ft init
